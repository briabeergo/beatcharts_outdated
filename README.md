## What is this application?
An application for the Beatstar modding community. Just an outdated version, you are welcome to do whatever you want with it.

# Short introduction to the classes
Utilities and tools:
- Class BeatChartsUtils: Contains everything that can be helpful in the application or have specific data. It's subclasses:
1. class Sys: system API interactions;
2. class Data: data processing, such as formatting text;
3. class SimpleItem: this is a class for a card object with title and text, which I planned to use in many places in the application;
4. class Animations: VERY IMPORTANT that all application animations should be declared there (constraint sets don't count). XML animations should be replaced with these animations;
5. class FilesData: only contains bytes needed for chart conversion files (Maybe there is a better way to use any kind of assets, but it makes no sense. Memory leaks can also be easily fixed with this).

Some important classes:
- class DeEncodingManager: all encoding/decoding (and chart conversion) logic is placed here;
- class SongManager: all song display, copy, delete and other operations are there.

There are more classes and some cpp functions, but you can easily figure out what they do

## What should be deleted
- BackendlessDef: I don't use backendless anymore;
- class ActionPerformed: this notification has been replaced by ActionNotify.
